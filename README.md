## Lyrics

```
all my weary brothers are forgiving beyond death ya 
control their point of valor till the lies take our breath
here's what remains  remember shrouded faces 
sitting at their graves we remain still impatient, life's a test

what remains is fellow feeling always nearing our last steps
make it count such a dull life till you drop dead 

get rid of all endorsements
they are not you, they are false threads, pay your dues

you know deep inside what you want
you are not what they would call their own 
you know deep inside what you want
you are not what they would call their own 
their own normalcy pride of the formal forms 
of conduct high tide only takes us apart
rampant modes of all that is lost truly lost to us

```
